"""Toast notification utilities for DualKSampler.

This module encapsulates ComfyUI's PromptServer integration for sending
toast notifications to the UI. All operations gracefully handle the case
where PromptServer is not available (e.g., during testing or if server
import fails).

Toast notifications are used to communicate important information to users:
- Dry-run validation results
- Overlap warnings between sampling stages
- Configuration recommendations
